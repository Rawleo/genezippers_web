Website repository for the **GeneZippers** Senior Comprehensive Study (Comps) project.

## About the Project

**"From Bases to Bits: An Analysis of Early DNA Compression Algorithms"**

This project evaluates three distinct data compression strategies to assess their efficacy in handling massive genomic datasets. We compare a general text-based approach (Huffman Coding) against two specialized DNA compressors:
*   **DNAzip** (reference-based)
*   **Biocompress 1** (non-reference-based)

This repository contains the source code for the project's presentation website, which hosts our paper, posters, and team information.
